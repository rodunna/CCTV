_A small multi purpose Discord bot written in JavaScript._

## What is the purpose?

**EN-UM** is a small bot that does the following ...

1.  User logging
    - Adds all new users to a small _Postgres_ database, along with their Discord uID (User ID) and join number.
2.  Nickname management
    - Gives users either an alphanumeric _(e.g, AA-00)_ nickname, or a Roman numeral one _(e.g, I)_ based on their guild join number.

## How do I set up the bot?

I am likely **never** gonna fill out this section as only I will be using it, but why not add it?
